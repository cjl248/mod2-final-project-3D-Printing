- Want to get IMAGES of organs on the "Current Price for this Organ Page" i.e. the user-organ #show page
-Update balance when you store or sell
-penalize users for visiting the user-organ show page directly
OR EVEN BETTER: make users unable to visit a show page directly without hitting the button first 
- STRETCH Making it update LIVE-TIME as users check component boxes to build their organ... (i.e. if you select a $100 component, even if you haven't SUBMITTED the form yet, the balance header at the top of the page should flicker to $400). 
- STYLING everything out with CSS

STRETCH

- MAKING a user get charged for storing - being unable ot leave organ show page without choosing to either sell or store their organ
