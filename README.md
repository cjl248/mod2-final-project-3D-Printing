- Want to get IMAGES of organs on the "Current Price for this Organ Page" i.e. the user-organ #show page

-Update balance when you store or sell

-penalize users for visiting the user-organ show page directly

- STRETCH Making it update LIVE-TIME as users check component boxes to build their organ... (i.e. if you select a $100 component, even if you haven't SUBMITTED the form yet, the balance header at the top of the page should flicker to $400). 

- STYLING everything out with CSS
