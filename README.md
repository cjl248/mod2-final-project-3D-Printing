Current Functions to work on

- LOGIN - storing the logged in user for a session - making sure all of our controllers, views etc. have access to the logged in user's id in a helper method

- adding a #minimum_components column to organs and FLASHING a "Must choose at least *~some number~* components to build a *~some organ*~ BEFORE flashing any other error
- FLASHING the missing_errors one by one across the screen

- make a giant BALANCE header that is at the top of the page no matter where the user goes (whatever page they go it should show up).

- STRETCH Making it update LIVE-TIME as users check component boxes to build their organ... (i.e. if you select a $100 component, even if you haven't SUBMITTED the form yet, the balance header at the top of the page should flicker to $400).
